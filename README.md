## The Cognate programming language
Cognate is a stack oriented, dynamically typed, functional programming language designed to help programmers specify their intent. Cognate uses optional syntax in order to help programmers write statements that are (mostly) readable in plain English and to include extra information about what statements are for, not just what they do and how they work. This leads to more maintainable codebases. Cognate's syntax is much simpler than other languages that aim for readability such as python, making the language consistent and simple to implement. This repository contains CognaC - the Cognate Compiler.

### Cognate is readable
As the above program shows, words starting with lower-case letters are ignored by the compiler (and are not highlighted). This allows comments and code to be easily bundled together, enhancing readability and allowing programmers to more easily express their intentions. While this means that Cognate can be very verbose, verbosity can be a good thing - this 'informal syntax' gives extra information to anyone reading the source.

### Cognate is fast
CognaC compiles Cognate directly to C. This produces very efficient binaries and allows Cognate to run much faster than many interpreted languages such as Python. However, it is easily outpaced by other compiled languages like Haskell and C++ that optimise more aggressively. However, Cognate has a huge potential for optimisation. In future, I will be able to implement many of these optimisations and make Cognate even faster. It is also worth noting that CognaC produces very small binaries. This could make Cognate a candidate for a scripting language in embedded environments.

### Cognate is simple
Cognate has only a handful of syntax elements. In future, this will allow me to elegantly introduce compile time macros and reflection, similar to those found in lisp dialects, that manipulate the syntax tree directly. I am also looking at implementing Forth-style code metaprogramming with immediate words, etc.

### Cognate is functional
Cognate is optimised for functional programming - not complicated static-typed functional programming with monads and applicative functors as you might see in a Haskell program, but the more simplistic dynamically typed functional programming often seen in scheme dialects. In Cognate, a bracketed expression (known as a Block) represents a closure - an anonymous function that inherits variables from where it was defined. These allow functions to be passed as arguments and returned from other functions. Cognate also discourages variable mutation in favour of shadowing variables instead and limiting side-effects.

### Cognate is powerful
The stack, around which cognate is designed, allows Cognate to do things which many other languages cannot. One example is multiple return values. While other languages - such as python - require the use of tuples or lists to return multiple values, Cognate uses the stack to achieve this without the use of any data structures. Cognate also uses the stack to allow any expression to be written in point-free notation.

### Building Cognate
Currently, Cognate will run on Linux and MacOS systems. If you use Windows 10, then you can install Cognate on the Windows Subsystem for Linux. To build Cognate, you will need make, flex, bison, clang. After installing dependencies, simply run this command to build the compiler and runtime.
```
make
```
If that succeeds, install the compiler with the following command:
```
sudo make install
```
This installs cognate to the /usr/local prefix. To install to a different directory, use this command:
```
sudo make PREFIX=/my/prefix/dir install
```
You should then run the test script to test Cognate's functionality. This should work regardless of operating system.
```
make test
```
If the tests all pass (they should!), you can then try running some of the included demo programs like this:
```
cognac examples/fizzbuzz.cog -run
```
